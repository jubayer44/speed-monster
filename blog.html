            <h2 class="text-center fw-semibold">The Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage.</h1>
            <h5 class="text-muted">Both local and session storages are key-value stores, meaning that they both store data in a dictionary format. The value of each key has to be a string, so if you have complex data structures like objects or arrays, you will need to serialize them using JSON strings. They both have a similar size limit, which is around five megabytes. <br> <br> Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the user closes its browser window. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each one will have its own page session. Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or manually.</h5>

            <h2 class="text-center fw-semibold">The Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope.</h2>
            <h5 class="text-muted"><b>Global Scoped:</b> A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a global scope variable. Global scoped can be used anywhere in the program. The value of a global variable can be changed inside a function. Global variable can change in different areas in the program. <br>
            <b>Block Scoped:</b> This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let and const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block.</h5>

            <h2 class="text-center fw-semibold">How does javascript event loop work?</h2>
            <h5 class="text-muted">The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.</h5>

                <li><h5>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined.</h5></li>

                <li><h5>Property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined.</h5></li>

                <li><h5>Deleting an element inside an array.</h5></li>
